Atis:

* Just like FPS, output other things like "number of visible tiles",
  "number of collisions considered", "number of collision handlers executed"
  etc etc
  Also do this engine side, since scripts shouldn't bother with this stuff.
  In fact, having a GetFPS function is probably unnecessary.
* Shatter slow-down bug.
* Path/curve object for NPC/platform/etc movement and perhaps much more
* Engine doc: intro+examples most importantly
* Vertex buffer objects.
